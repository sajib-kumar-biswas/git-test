								-----------------
						1. Never give up
						
						----- Winners never quit, and quitters never win
						
						2. Planning is the key
						
						----- A goal without a plan is just a wish.
						
						3. Mistakes are secret key to success
						
						----- The greatest mistake that a man can ever make is to be afraid of making one
						
						4. It's all about problem solving
						
						----- Problems are not stopping signs, they are guidelines
						
						5. You have to learn by yourself
						
						----- Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching
						
						6. Be consistent
						
						----- Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency. Consistent hard work 								leads to success. Greatness will come.
